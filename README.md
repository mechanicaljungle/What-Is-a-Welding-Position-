What Is a Welding Position?
---------------------------

Welding is often done on structures in the position in which they are found and in the position the part will be used.

Often that may be on the ceiling, in the corner, or on the floor.

Techniques have been developed to allow welding in any position. Some welding processes have all-position capabilities, while others may be used in only one or two positions.

All welding can be classified according to the position of the workpiece or the position of the welded joint on the plates or sections being welded.

The American Welding Society has defined the four basic welding positions as shown below.

Flat Position Welding Procedures
--------------------------------

To make good bead welds on a plate surface, the flare motion, tip angle, and position of the welding flame above the molten puddle should be carefully maintained.

The welding torch should be adjusted to give the proper type of flame for the particular metal being welded.

Narrow bead welds are made by raising and lowering the welding flare with a slight circular motion while progressing forward.

The tip should form an angle of approximately 45 degrees with the plate surface. The flame will be pointed in the welding direction.
